# ObjectFinder
Find things in SONAR images.

Call the base function `findObjects()` and pass the (colour & noisy) image to it. Wait a while. Think about a few things- life, the atoms, the universe and so on.. It returns a cell-array of found ROIs from the image, so be sure to have an `Lvalue` or be ready to have all sorts of crap on your prompt.

The pipeline used is still under active consideration. There are different methods that will be updated here.

Patience is much appreciated, almost as much as candies. ;)
